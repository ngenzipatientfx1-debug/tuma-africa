Project Vision: "Tuma-Africa Link Cargo" — Your Personal Gateway to Global ShoppingYour Mission: Create a full-stack web application that redefines the proxy-shopping experience for users in Africa buying from China. The goal is not just to be functional, but to be beautifully simple, innovative, and trustworthy.The entire user experience must be clean, intuitive, and fluid, with purposeful animations that guide the user and make the platform a pleasure to use. Think "effortless." The user should feel as secure and comfortable as if they were using a top-tier messaging or banking app.Core UX/UI & Design Philosophy (The "Feel")1. The Homepage: The "Magic" Link BoxAesthetic: Minimalist, clean, and inspiring. The hero area (video/carousel, editable by Super Admin) should be high-impact.The Focus: The only main call-to-action on the page should be the link paste section. It should be inviting.Animation: When a user pastes a link, don't just load a new page. Animate this transition. The box could expand, or the screen could smoothly slide to reveal the "Order Info Form." This must feel intelligent and responsive.2. The Order Form: "Smart & Simple"This form must not feel like work.File Uploads: The screenshot upload (≤150 KB) should be a modern drag-and-drop box with an instant preview. Show a clean, animated progress bar.Fields: Make the fields for quantity, variation, and specifications feel light and easy to fill.3. The Dashboards: "Clarity & Control"User Dashboard: This is the trust center.Order Tracking: Don't just use text (e.g., "In Warehouse"). Create a visual, graphical timeline for each order. Show icons for "Purchased" $\rightarrow$ "Warehouse" $\rightarrow$ "Shipping" $\rightarrow$ "In-country," with the current step highlighted. This is a key "modern" feature.Inbox: The chat must be clean, fast, and familiar—just like WhatsApp or iMessage.Admin/Employee Dashboards: These should be clean, data-first interfaces. The priority is efficiency. The search (by ID or username) must be instant.4. The Compressor Utility: "A Sleek Tool"The "Photo Compressor" should be a beautiful, standalone utility page.Use a large, inviting drag-and-drop area.Provide clear, animated feedback during compression and a simple, obvious download button.5. Micro-interactions (The "Polish")Buttons should have subtle hover and click animations.Page transitions should be smooth fades or slides.Loading states should use a custom, elegant spinner, not the browser default.These small details are what will make the app feel "innovative" and "user-friendly."Mandatory Technical Architecture (The "Blueprint")This creative vision must be built on the following exact technical specifications. Do not deviate from this architecture.1. PurposeA web app for African users to buy from Chinese e-commerce platforms via link submission.Manages order processing, verification, shipping updates, and secure chat.2. Technology StackFrontend: React.jsBackend: Node.js + Express.jsDatabase: MongoDBAuthentication: OAuth (Google) + custom signupMedia Storage: Cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary)Real-time Chat: WebSockets or Firebase Realtime DatabaseFile Handling: Node.js libraries (e.g., Sharp for images).3. User Roles (Implement Strict Role-Based Access Control)User: Registers, verifies account, places orders, chats.Order Processing Employee: Handles orders, updates status, chats with users/admin.Admin: Verifies users, manages employees, approves/declines orders, monitors analytics.Super Admin: Full control: CMS (Hero, About Us, Policies, Social Links, Other Companies), all analytics, all admin functions.4. Backend ArchitectureModules:Authentication & Authorization: OAuth + email/phone verification.Order Management: MongoDB storage with unique IDs. Status tracking: Purchased $\rightarrow$ Warehouse $\rightarrow$ In Transit $\rightarrow$ Delivered.Media Handling: Image compression (15 MB $\rightarrow$ 100–150 KB). Strict validation (size & type).Messaging Module: Real-time chat (text, image, video, doc) with specified size limits.User Verification: Secure collection of name, phone, government ID, selfie. Admin approval workflow.Content Management Module (Super Admin): CRUD for Hero, About Us, Terms, Privacy, Social Links, Other Companies.Database Structure (MongoDB):Users Collection: { _id, name, phone, email, role, verified, governmentID (encrypted), selfie (encrypted/URL), createdAt }Orders Collection: { _id, userId, orderID, productName, productScreenshot (URL), quantity, variation, specifications, notes, status, createdAt, updatedAt }Messages Collection: { _id, fromUserId, toUserId, type, content (text or URL), createdAt }Content Collection: { _id, type, data, lastUpdated }5. File & Media ManagementUse Node.js + Sharp for image compression.Use cloud storage for all media.Auto-delete temporary files (like from the compressor).Strictly enforce file limits: $\le$150 KB for images (user-to-employee), $\le$2 MB for video/documents (employee-to-user).6. SecurityEncrypt all sensitive fields in MongoDB.Implement secure upload endpoints (validate type, size).Use HTTPS for all connections.Ensure regular database backups.
